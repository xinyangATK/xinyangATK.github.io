**My research interests** lie in the general area of probablistic modeling, particularly in solving real-world problems through advanced Generative AI systems. 
My recent research focuses on **Generative Modeling**, including its theoretical exploration and various applications in data generation and multimodal learning. 
I am also highly interested in 2D & 3D generation, robot learning, planning, and agent learning upon Generative AI.
