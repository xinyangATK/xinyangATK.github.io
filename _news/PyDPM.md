:fire::fire::fire: We have open sourced a new version of **[PyDPM](https://github.com/BoChenGroup/PyDPM)**, and welcome to join the open source library of deep probabilistic models!
\\
**PyDPM** is a python library focuses on constructing **D**eep **P**robabilistic **M**odels (**DPMs**). Our developed Pydpm not only provides efficient distribution sampling functions on GPU, but also has included the implementations of existing popular DPMs.
