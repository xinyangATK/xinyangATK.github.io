## **Bio**
Howdy! I am a research intern at Purdue University, advised by [Dr. Ruqi Zhang](https://ruqizhang.github.io). I'm also work closely with [Prof. Mingyuan Zhou](https://mingyuanzhou.github.io), an Associate Professor at the University of Texas at Austin. I received my M.S degree from Xidian University in 2024, advised by [Prof. Bo Chen](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/bchen/). Previously, I obtained my B.S degree from Xidian University in 2021.

**My research interests** lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in solving practical problems through advanced Generative AI systems. 
My recent researches focus on **Generative Modeling**, including its theoretical exploration and various applications in data generation and multi/cross-modal learning.

:fire::fire::fire: <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px">Now I'm looking for PhD 25 Fall and here is my [CV](https://xinyangatk.github.io/assets/pdf/LXY_CV.pdf) !</span>

**In addition**, I am very interested in robot learning, decision-making, and AI4Science within the framework of Generative AI.
