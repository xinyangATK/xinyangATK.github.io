One paper ["PatchCT: Aligning Patch Set and Label Set with Conditional Transport for Multi-Label Image Classification"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09066) is accepted by **ICCV 2023**! We formulate the multi-label classification as a CT problem and exploit the interactions between the image and label efficiently by minimizing the bidirectional CT cost.
