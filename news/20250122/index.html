Much appreciation to all of my collaborators and advisors! <br> In <a href="https://xinyangatk.github.io" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">“Optimal Stochastic Trace Estimation in Generative Modeling”</a> (<strong>AISTATS 2025</strong>), we leverage the Hutch++ estimator in generative modeling and propose a practical algorithm that amortizes decompositions to reduce costs, while also providing theoretical guarantees specifically in generative modeling context. <br> In <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09357" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">“Advancing Graph Generation through Beta Diffusion”</a> (<strong>ICLR 2025</strong>), we futher explore the potential of Beta Diffusion in graph modeling and propose a novel graph-driven generative process with concentration modulation technique, which makes Beta Diffusion unique again!</p> </body></html>
