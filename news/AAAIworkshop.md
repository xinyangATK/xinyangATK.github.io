Our paper ["MolGuide: 2D Molecular Optimization with Preserved Structural Motifs Guidance"](https://llms4science-community.github.io/papers/LLMs4Bio24_paper_4.pdf) is accepted by the workshop **[AAAI 2024: LLMs4Bio](https://llms4science-community.github.io/aaai2024.html)**. It's my first attempt at **"Graph Generation"**, where we are doing something new under this topic, please stay tuned! -->
