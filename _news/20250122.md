<span style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand', cursive; color: #FF5809; font-weight: 900;">Happy Birthday</span>üç∞üïØÔ∏èüëë The best gifts come from two accepted papers! Much appreciation to all of my collaborators and advisors!
\\
In ["Optimal Stochastic Trace Estimation in Generative Modeling"](https://xinyangatk.github.io) (**AISTATS 2025**), we leverage the Hutch++ estimator in generative modeling and propose a practical algorithm that amortizes decompositions to reduce costs, while also providing theoretical guarantees specifically in generative modeling context.
\\
In ["Advancing Graph Generation through Beta Diffusion"](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09357) (**ICLR 2025**), we futher explore the potential of Beta Diffusion in graph modeling and propose a novel graph-driven generative process with concentration modulation technique, which makes Beta Diffusion unique again!
