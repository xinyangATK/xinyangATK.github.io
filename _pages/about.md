## **Bio**
Howdy! I am the first-year PhD student at The University of Texas at Austin <img src="/assets/img/ut-logo.png" width="65">, advised by **[<u>Prof. Mingyuan Zhou</u>](https://mingyuanzhou.github.io)**. 
I received my M.S degree from Xidian University in 2024, advised by **[<u>Prof. Bo Chen</u>](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/bchen/)**. 
Previously, I obtained my B.S degree from Xidian University in 2021.

**My research interests** lie in the general area of probablistic modeling, particularly in solving real-world problems through advanced Generative AI systems. 
My recent research focuses on **Generative Modeling**, including its **<u>theory exploration and various applications in data generation (e.g., dLLMs) and multimodal learning.</u>** 
I am currently exploring **all dimensions of diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs)**, including foundation-model design, inference acceleration, and post-training for downstream tasks.

If you share the same research interests with me, feel free to reach out or add my [WeChat](./assets/img/wechat.jpg).

I'm actively looking for <strong style="color: red;">internship opportunities starting in Summer 2026</strong>. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in my research.
